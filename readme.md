### 6. Answer the following questions clearly:

1. What is the difference between **getElementById, getElementsByClassName, and querySelector / querySelectorAll**?

  These are like different ways to find someone in a crowd (your webpage).

  getElementById("id")	Finds an element by its unique ID. For example : Finds one person with a specific ID card.
  getElementsByClassName("class") Finds all elements with the same class. HTMLCollection (like an array, but live). Example : look for all people wearing “blue t-shirts”.
  querySelector("selector")	Finds the first element matching a CSS selector. Example :	You say “the first person wearing blue t-shirt”.
  querySelectorAll("selector")	Finds all elements matching a CSS selector. NodeList (like array, but static). Example :	You say “everyone wearing blue t-shirts”.
